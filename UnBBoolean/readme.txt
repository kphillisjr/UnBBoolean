INTRODUCTION:
UnBBoolean is an application to combine primitive solids with boolean operations based on the Constructive Solid Geometry. 

COMPILED WITH:
Java 2 SDK 1.4.0
Java 3D 1.3

BRIEF TUTORIAL:
1 - CREATING PRIMITIVES: In the 'Primitives' tab, choose a primitive into the list of primitives. Then, change the parameters of the choosen primitive as you like. Finally, press 'OK' button.

2 - MOVING SOLIDS: Dragging the solid with the left mouse button makes it move around the screen (x and y translation). Using the right button, the solid is rotated (x and y rotation). Dragging and holding ALT button makes it move to the user direction or the opposite one (z translation). Just to remind, x axis points right, y axis points up and z axis points to the user direction.

3 - REMOVING SOLIDS: Select the solid to be removed on the screen with the mouse button. Press 'delete' button on the keyboard. 

3 - COMBINING SOLIDS: Holding CTRL, select both solids that will be combined, position them as you like, choose the desired operation into the 'CSG trees' tab and press 'OK' button

4 - CHANGING SOLIDS:
A)Changing solid parameters: Select the solid to be changed on the screen with the mouse button. Its tree will be shown on the left into the 'CSG trees' tab. Select the node you'd like to change. Change the parameters in the panel below, and then press 'OK' button.
B)Moving primitive components of a compound solid: Select the solid to be changed on the screen with the mouse button. Its tree will be shown on the left into the 'CSG trees' tab. Right click the tree leaf relative to the primitive you'd like to change. A popup menu appears. Select 'move' item. Then, move the primitive on the screen as you like. If you want to change its parameters, change it on the  panel below the tree and then press 'OK' button and keep on moving it. After the primitive is on the right position, press 'stop moving' button.

5 - COPYING A SOLID: Select the solid to be copied on the screen with the mouse button. Its tree will be shown on the left into the 'CSG trees' tab. Right click the tree root. A popup menu appears. Select 'copy' item. If you instead want to copy one of its intermediate solids, do the same for its node on the tree.

6 - SAVE/LOAD A SOLID: On the menu bar, File>Save or File>Load. It saves and loads files in a 'csg' format, which stores the tree structure and parameters. Coordinates can be saved in a 'obj' file too, to be used by other applications.
