        TO CREATE A PRIMITIVE:
        <br />
        In the &#39;Primitives&#39; tab, choose a primitive into the list of primitives. Change 
        the parameters of the chosen primitive as you like. Finally, press &#39;OK&#39; button.
    </p>
    <p>
        TO MOVE A SOLID:
        <br />
        Dragging the solid with the left mouse button makes it move around the screen (x 
        and y translation). Using the right button, the solid is rotated (x and y 
        rotation). Dragging and holding ALT button makes it move to the user direction 
        or the opposite one (z translation).

    <p>
        TO REMOVE A SOLID:
        <br />
        Select the solid to be removed on the screen with the mouse button. Press 
        &#39;delete&#39; button on the keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        TO COMBINE SOLIDS:
        <br />
        Holding CTRL, select both solids that will be combined, position them as you 
        like, choose the desired operation into the &#39;CSG trees&#39; tab and press &#39;OK&#39; 
        button
    </p>
    <p>
        TO CHANGE&nbsp; A SOLID:
        <br />
        a) Change solid parameters: Select the solid to be changed on the screen with 
        the mouse button. Its tree will be shown on the left into the &#39;CSG trees&#39; tab. 
        Select the node you&#39;d like to change. Change the parameters in the panel below, 
        and then press &#39;OK&#39; button.        <br />
        b)b) Move primitive components of a compound solid: Select the solid to be changed 
        on the screen with the mouse button. Its tree will be shown on the left into the 
        &#39;CSG trees&#39; tab. Right click the tree leaf relative to the primitive you&#39;d like 
        to change. A popup menu appears. Select &#39;move&#39; item. Then, move the primitive on 
        the screen as you like. If you want to change its parameters, change it on the 
        panel below the tree and then press &#39;OK&#39; button and keep on moving it. After the 
        primitive is on the right position, press &#39;stop moving&#39; button.
    </p>
    <p>
        TO COPY A SOLID:
        <br />
        Select the solid to be copied on the screen with the mouse button. Its tree will 
        be shown on the left into the &#39;CSG trees&#39; tab. Right click the tree root. A 
        popup menu appears. Select &#39;copy&#39; item. If you want to copy one of its 
        intermediate solids instead, do the same with its node on the tree.</p>
    <p>
&nbsp;TO SAVE/LOAD A SOLID:
        <br />
        On the menu bar, File&gt;Save or File&gt;Load. It saves and loads files in a &#39;csg&#39; 
        format, which stores the tree structure and parameters. Coordinates can be saved 
        in a &#39;obj&#39; file too, to be used by other applications.
